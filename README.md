# grayscale_images_colorization
Grayscale image colorization is a machine learning project that uses a deep learning model, typically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to automatically add color to black-and-white images. The model is trained on a large dataset to learn how to predict color from grayscale values, effectively "painting" a full-color image.
